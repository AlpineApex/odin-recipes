        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Considered one of Iran’s culturally significant dishes, Ghormeh Sabzi is a rich beef stew 
            with a unique and complex flavor profile, which results from slow-cooking fresh herbs and 
            dried limes with beef and red kidney beans. Quite simply you will fall in love with this 
            dish, as it’s sour, savory, decadent and delicious. There’s just nothing else like it!

            The unique flavor of this traditional beef stew comes from the cooking technique, in which 
            chopped herbs are fried to develop a deep, complex flavor. The stew becomes both darker and 
            more intense the longer you cook the herbs. That’s why you see different shades of Ghormeh Sabzi: 
            Some are more vibrant green while others are so dark they almost look black.

            This Ghormeh Sabzi recipe leans towards the green end of the spectrum. I like to cook the herbs 
            until they are dark green but not black, as darker versions can sometimes be bitter. Cooking the 
            herbs until they are dark green intensifies the flavors, but maintains the bright flavors from using 
            fresh herbs.
