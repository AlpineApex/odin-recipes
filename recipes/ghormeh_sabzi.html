        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Considered one of Iran’s culturally significant dishes, Ghormeh Sabzi is a rich beef stew 
            with a unique and complex flavor profile, which results from slow-cooking fresh herbs and 
            dried limes with beef and red kidney beans. Quite simply you will fall in love with this 
            dish, as it’s sour, savory, decadent and delicious. There’s just nothing else like it!
        </p>
        <p>
            The unique flavor of this traditional beef stew comes from the cooking technique, in which 
            chopped herbs are fried to develop a deep, complex flavor. The stew becomes both darker and 
            more intense the longer you cook the herbs. That’s why you see different shades of Ghormeh Sabzi: 
            Some are more vibrant green while others are so dark they almost look black. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This Ghormeh Sabzi recipe leans towards the green end of the spectrum. I like to cook the herbs 
            until they are dark green but not black, as darker versions can sometimes be bitter. Cooking the 
            herbs until they are dark green intensifies the flavors, but maintains the bright flavors from using 
            fresh herbs.

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> 
                <b>Start the stew.</b> In a large pot or dutch oven, add a generous drizzle of oil, and cook the onions 
                over medium heat when it’s hot. Saute the onions until they’re slightly golden. Then add the minced 
                garlic, ground turmeric, and black pepper. When the garlic is fragrant, stir in the meat and let it 
                sear evenly all over. Season the meat with salt, the bouillon cube, and add the water. Bring the 
                stew to a simmer, then lower the heat and simmer uncovered for an hour.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Simmer simmer simmer.</b> Poke holes in the dried limes with a fork or a paring knife. Then add them to
                the stew. Cover the pot with a lid but leave a sliver so that the stew vents.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Saute the herbs.</b> When there’s roughly 20 minutes left. Add a glug of oil to a large skillet or deep saute 
                pan and add the herbs over medium-high heat. Saute the greens until they wilt down to less than half the 
                size. I use dried fenugreek and add that in during the last two minutes.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Simmer again.</b> Add the greens to the stew along with the drained kidney beans, cover the pot with a sliver to vent 
                and let it simmer again for an hour. The theme here is simmer! The lower and slower you cook this, the more 
                tender the meat and the more flavorful the stew!
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Serve it up.</b> Remove the dried limes and keep them to the side if you plan on serving them with the stew. Check the 
                meat to see if it’s done with a paring knife. If the knife goes through with some resistance, let it simmer for 
                longer until it’s super tender. When the meat is done, add the lemon juice. Taste and adjust with more salt as the 
                stew needs. Then serve it up with tahdig or basmati rice and shirazi salad.
            </li>
        </ol>
